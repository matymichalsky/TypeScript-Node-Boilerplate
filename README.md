# TypeScript Node Boilerplate
A TypeScript Node Boilerplate, for quick project starting, using [routing-controllers](https://github.com/typestack/routing-controllers), [typeorm](https://typeorm.io/#/) and [typedi](https://github.com/typestack/typedi) libraries.

## Development server
Run `npm run serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will server reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build
Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
